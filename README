# PyRobot-Dynamics

 PyRobot Dynamics provides an easy to use interface to
 - construct complex manipulators from D-H table and link specifications.
 - generate pdf files containing simplified Transformation Matrices, Dynamic Equations etc.
 - simulate the behaviour of the manipulator under various control schemes.
